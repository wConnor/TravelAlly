# TravelAlly (in development)
## Introduction
TravelAlly is a web-application designed to help travellers understand and navigate public transport in new countries. Whilst travelling myself, I noticed that many of the popular apps such as Google Maps, whilst work very well in highly developed, rich countries, it would give absurd results in some lesser-known places, sometimes recommending a six-hour route with five transfers instead of a simple one hour direct bus.
This app serves as a central place where users can submit transport routes between two cities with timetable information, which the application then uses in its calculation of the best way to go from point A to point B. This is known as the 'Route Planner' feature.
There is also a wiki-like feature where users can submit and edit information about a certain countries transportation systems for others to read.
